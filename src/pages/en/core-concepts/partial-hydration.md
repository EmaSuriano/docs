**Astro generates every website with zero client-side JavaScript, by default.** Use any frontend UI component that you'd like ([React](https://reactjs.org/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Lit](https://lit.dev/)) and Astro will automatically render it to HTML at build-time and strip away all JavaScript. This keeps every site fast by default.

```astro
---
// Example: Use a static React component on the page, without JavaScript.
import MyReactComponent from '../components/MyReactComponent.jsx';
---
<!-- 100% HTML, Zero JavaScript! -->
<MyReactComponent />
```

But sometimes, client-side JavaScript is required for creating interactive UI. When you find yourself needing interactive UI on the page, Astro doesn't force you to go 100% JavaScript on the entire page. Instead, Astro uses a technique called **partial hydration** that lets you hydrate individual components on the page. This way, you only send down the absolutely essential JavaScript that you need to run your page. 

```astro
---
// Example: Use a dynamic React component on the page.
import MyReactComponent from '../components/MyReactComponent.jsx';
---
<!-- This component is now interactive on the page! 
     The rest of your website remains the same. -->
<MyReactComponent client:load />
```

The vast majority of your site remains pure, lightweight HTML and CSS, with isolated **islands of interactivity.**


## Partial Hydration

There are plenty of cases where you need an interactive UI component to run in the browser:

- An image carousel
- An auto-complete search bar
- A mobile sidebar open/close button
- A "Buy Now" button

In Astro, itâ€™s up to you as the developer to explicitly opt in any components on the page that need to run in the browser. Astro will only hydrate exactly whatâ€™s needed on the page and leave the rest of your site as static HTML. This technique is known as **partial hydration**.

**Partial hydration is the secret to Astroâ€™s fast-by-default performance story.**
