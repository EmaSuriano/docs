Astro is a way to build fast websites, faster.

<!-- This is awkward, but I'm trying to introduce the notion of consciously thinking about HOW the site is built, with respect to delivering content -->
Astro asks, "How am I building this site, and sending its contents to my user as quickly and cleanly as possible?"

> Less web *app*; more web *site*.

Not every website needs to be, nor in many cases should be, a JavaScript app. Not blogs, not portfolios, and often not even interactive sites like eCommerce sites!

We've come a long way from the last generation of static site builders. With Astro, you can get what you liked about php, Wordpress, Rails etc. and also take advantage of the newest tech, ideas and tools that are currently locked into a web application way of thinking.

## Content-based

Astro helps you build a website by thinking of it as a **document**. It concerns itself with what it means to generate the markup that becomes your page, leaving you to create content!

Anyone who has content to share with the world should be able to build a website with the building blocks of HTML and CSS. Astro has built a system that feels modern, and gives you the benefit of thinking in components,  and taking advantage of server rendering... but that's easy to get up and running quickly with little more than knowledge of HTML and CSS.

For even more functionality, Astro lets you add so much more: CSS uilities, JS and UI Frameworks, CMS and eCommerce integrations... all while focusing on the content you ship to the browser. Astro runs its templating JS only at build time to create your static content, then bundles and optimizes your site into a lightweight package that is ready for your users sooner.


## HTML-first

HTML is really powerful!

Astro users discover that they end up writing a lot more HTML (with our "sugar" when they need to add an expression or component) than they are used to.

> When you think that everything is JavaScript, you're going to build everything in JavaScript!

Once you've been building with Astro, you'll wonder why you would write your templating in JavaScript when you have a markup language you can use that was specifically designed for it! Why create the middle step of writing JavaScript that's going to render to markup?

> Astro is built on top of HTML... even more so than `.jsx` or `.svelte` because **any valid HTML is also valid `.astro`**!

With Astro, simplicity is the default; you have to opt-in to complexity. Your site could be *just* HTML, and Astro is still going to bundle and optimize all the pieces. Your site can grow with you. Astro's optimization only gets better as you decide to do more.

Instead of trying to solve all parts of the stack, Astro is trying to solve your HTML templating.

An Astro component is an HTML template, but with all the power of how you think about components in React, Svelte or Vue. It is fully sever-rendered, in a markup language that looks and feels like (and even, can just be!) HTML.

## Future-proof

Astro is one of the only site builders that can give you an integrated way to build with React, Vue, Svelte etc. without making you pick one and stick with it!

There's always going to be something new and shiny that comes along. If you've built your project, site or company so deeply in one stack, it's going to be harder to experiment and try that one new thing.

For Astro, front-end frameworks are a way to build UI without betting on any single one:

- Different teams can use different frameworks, either as a permanent strategy, or as a way to allow some teams to experiment
- A project can slowly introduce new tech, feature-by-feature or even component-by-component, without going all-in right away.
- When you *do* want to change your tech stack, you don't have to build an entirely new site. Just incrementally replace older components with new ones!

<!-- I ideally want wordplay with "future proof"... something time-based, referencing the present (NOW) and/or the past (STABILITY, ENDURING). I don't love this yet; still workshopping it. -->

## Stands the Test of Time

Although you *can* import modern frameworks and take advantage of the latest and greatest thing, you don't *have* to. Astro provides a fully complete, static site generator ready to build your modern website without needing to rely on the latest trends.

Astro builds on a foundation of stable, battle-tested web elements (HTML, CSS) with modern DX tools and infrastructure to help you focus on sending your content to the user, not extra JavaScript.
