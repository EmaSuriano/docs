The following guides are based on some shared assumptions:

- You are using the default build output location (`dist/`). This location can be changed using the [`outDir` configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#outdir).
- You are using npm. You can use equivalent commands to run the scripts if you are using Yarn or other package managers.
- Astro is installed as a local dev dependency in your project, and you have set up the following npm scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "start": "astro dev",
    "build": "astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview"
  }
}
```

> These guides provide instructions for performing a static deployment of your Astro site. Astro also has support for Server Side Rendering (SSR). 
>

## Building The App

Run the command `npm run build` to build the app.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

By default, the build output will be placed at `dist/`. You may deploy this `dist/` folder to any of your preferred platforms.

## Netlify

You can configure your deployment in two ways, via the [Netlify website UI](#netlify-website-ui) or with a local project `netlify.toml` file.

### `netlify.toml` file

Create a new `netlify.toml` file at the top level of your project repository with the following settings:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
```

Using [`pnpm` on Netlify?](https://answers.netlify.com/t/using-pnpm-and-pnpm-workspaces/2759) Use the following settings instead:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NPM_FLAGS = "--version" # prevent Netlify npm install
[build]
  command = 'npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && npm run build'
  publish = 'dist'
```

Push the new `netlify.toml` file up to your hosted git repository. Then, set up a new project on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) for your git repository. Netlify will read this file and automatically configure your deployment.


> If you are using an older [build image](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/#build-image-selection) on Netlify, make sure that your Node.js version is set.

You can specify your Node.js version in:
- a [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc) file (example: `node v14.17.6`) 
- a `NODE_VERSION` environment variable in your site's settings using the Netlify project dashboard.

### Netlify Website UI

You can skip the `netlify.toml` file and go directly to [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) to configure your project. Netlify should now detect Astro projects automatically and pre-fill the configuration for you. Make sure that the following settings are entered before hitting the "Deploy" button:

- **Build Command:** `astro build` or `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist`
